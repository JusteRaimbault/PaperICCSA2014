We describe an hybrid agent-based model coupling a cellular automata and a dynamic network, for the simulation of urban growth. Heterogeneous aspects of urban systems are taken into account in the sense that morphologic structure but also functional properties of the city are implied in the evolution. Classic measures of description and performances for generated configuration are used to classify and explore generated patterns, and we also propose an economic evaluation of the structure using sensitivity of segregation models to spatial configuration. We can apply the model to a real-world situation, proposing an optimisation of the repartition of activities in a zoning context.
